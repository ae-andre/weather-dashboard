## Description

A weather dashboard that runs in a browser and features dynamically updated HTML elements and CSS.

The dashboard uses OpenWeather API to pull temperature, wind, and humidity data for any specified city.

Users can also see a list of their previous searches which can be clicked on to search for that city again.
